Once upon a time there was a very nice family and they went on a lot of adventures.
For instance, they went on an adventure with a boat. 
One day they were guided by a whale to a far away island.
the island was filled with coconut trees
the family was resting under a coconut tree
one large coconut fell on the father's head and he lost his memory
